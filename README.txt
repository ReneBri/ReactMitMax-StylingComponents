So really delving into styled components here. I found this at first really tedious because I didnt learn it in my other course and had never heard of it. Upon further research I found it is really popular, so learning it was essential. It does make sense and is quite easy. It throws the concept of seperation of concerns out the window though. I guess theres a lot of different styles/philosophies when it comes to coding, so learning as many as possible then finding my own style is a good idea. And learning a lot means I will be highly adaptive when I finally get hired by a company one day. I just hope my first company uses functional components rather than classbased.
